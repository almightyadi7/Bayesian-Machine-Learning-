# Bayesian Machine Learning
Created Bayesian Linear Regression model using PyMC3(MCMC model) ML package to predict final grade of students
Built Bayesian Neural network using Pyro & Pytorch, to predict the final grade on the same data set used for BLR prediction
Both the approaches Pyro & Pytorch outperformed other classical approaches like Linear Regression, SVM & Random Forest
